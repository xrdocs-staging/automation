# Overview

Crosswork Planning provides a comprehensive suite of tools to empower operators to proactively manage their network infrastructure. These tools offer capabilities for network discovery, analysis, simulation, and optimization. With Crosswork Planning, operators can unlock a host of benefits, including enhanced visibility and insights, improved performance, reliability, and resiliency, and efficient capacity management.

The Design application may be used to visualize topology, run simulations as well as perform optimizations and uses network models which has been created prior, or built using the Collector application.

The Collector application allow us to perform network discovery, collection and model buildling using a variety of supported methods. The collector application takes as its input configuration pertaining to basic and advanced model building and for traffic and demands. Based on these configuration, the collector application reaches out to the network elements to perform collection of the desired attributes to populate the network model. It will produce an output network model (ie. plan file) for the collection, containing objects such as nodes, interfaces, demands, etc. The collection process is designed to be extensible, allowing for the use of scripts to augment basic collection, or for custom collection.

This tutorial provides a brief overview of setting up Crosswork Planning collector.

# Getting started with Collection

After logging in to Crosswork Planning, we select the Collector option to access the Collector configuration.
